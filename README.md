here's a script that adds a pannel with a button you click to add LODs to any selected object!

just click, edit, add ons, this little arrow, "install from disk" , and install the .py script


then you'll get an N pannel option on the right hand side

then select the object you'd like to add the LODS to, and simply click the "Add LOD Properies" button and BOOM you're done!

Its just a .py script instead of a zipped folder so you can read through it, i know people are worried about malicious addons so i just wants to be really easily transparent with it
